# SSPE-sims
 Code repository to recreate the simulations and plots of "A State Space Modeling Approach to Real-Time Phase Estimation" paper. 
 
 Note that data from the simulations exists already at Figshare, however, they can also be recreated by running the simulations in the SSPE-sims/simulations folder. 
 
 Be sure to add all libraries in the folder to the path before running simulations. Further this folder also requires the user to download and add to path the "SSPE" library, available here: https://github.com/wodeyara/stateSpacePhasePredictor.git
