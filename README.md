# SSPE-sims
Code repository to recreate the simulations and plots in [A State Space Modeling Approach to Real-Time Phase Estimation](https://elifesciences.org/articles/68803). 
 
Note that data from the simulations exists already at Figshare, however, they can also be recreated by running the simulations 
in the SSPE-sims/simulations folder. 
 
Be sure to add all libraries in the folder to the path before running simulations. 
Code from Zrenner et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116761) 
and from Blackwood, Lo and Widge, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513232) added here for ease of use.

Please examine demo and muRhythmDemo.mlx and the help in different functions to understand the process of using this code.
