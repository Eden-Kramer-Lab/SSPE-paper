# SSPE-sims
 Code repository to recreate the simulations and plots in [A State Space Modeling Approach to Real-Time Phase Estimation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.25.437024v2) . 
 
 Note that data from the simulations exists already at Figshare, however, they can also be recreated by running the simulations in the SSPE-sims/simulations folder. 
 
 Be sure to add all libraries in the folder to the path before running simulations.

# SSPE
Estimating phase in real time with a state space model tracking the analytic signal.
 
Please examine demo and the help in different functions to understand the process of using this code.
